Welcome to my dotfiles and small scripts!

Currently using: ack, bash (rc and profile), git (config and global ignore), pep8, tmux, ctags, vim, i3, pylint

Not really using, but still cluttering up the place: hg, zsh (good on paper, but one of my vim plugins didn't get along with it).

And there are some scripts to: start clojure from the command line, do hg and svn diffs with vim, launch and orphan a program from the command line, a logout / suspend / shutdown GUI dialog for use with i3, and a template to create a preconfigured tmux-session.
