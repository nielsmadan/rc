Dark, high contrast gvim colorscheme inspired by [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) and [badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf).

You can also get it from vim.org [here](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4195).

### properties ###

- dark background, warm colors, high contrast, but nothing too garish
- everything that's constantly on screen and not code is low key
- not too many very different colors in close proximity

### contribute ###

Pull requests welcome. Please open issues if you find something that looks wonky.

### languages/plugins ###

Currently hand-optimized for the following languages:

C, python, clojure, vimscript, xml, html, and ruby (though ruby still doesn't look so hot)

And the following plugins:

minibufexplorer, vim-easymotion, vimdiff
