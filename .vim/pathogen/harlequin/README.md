## harlequin ##

Dark, high contrast gvim colorscheme inspired by [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) and [badwolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf).

### features ###

- warm colors
- areas around code are low key
- not too many very different colors in close proximity
- legible comments (not the light grey comments on a grey background of molokai/badwolf and other themes)
