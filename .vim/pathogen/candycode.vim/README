This is my personal colorscheme, which I've been carefully tweaking over the past couple years.  It uses a (nearly) black background contrasted with bright pastel colors, which I think are easy to read and rather purty, too.  I don't know of any colorschemes that are too similar, but then again I've only seen a fraction of the huge number that are out there.

Optimized for the GUI version, but color terminal settings are included, too.
